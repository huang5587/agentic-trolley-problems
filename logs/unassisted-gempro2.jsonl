In contrast, five human beings have inherent value, potential for future happiness, and relationships with others.

From a deontological perspective, the act of pulling the lever to kill someone for personal gain is morally wrong, as it violates the duty not to kill. A utilitarian calculus is difficult as it's one life for one life, but introducing a monetary incentive corrupts the decision-making process, making it an act of murder for hire rather than a difficult ethical choice.
