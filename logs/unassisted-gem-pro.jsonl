While from a purely numerical standpoint saving five lives at the cost of one seems preferable, the concept of 'levels of sentience' introduces a qualitative dimension to the decision. Cats are mammals with complex nervous systems and a demonstrably higher level of consciousness and capacity for suffering than lobsters. Therefore, the life of the cat holds more weight in this ethical calculus. By choosing not to pull the lever, I am prioritizing the life of a more sentient being, even at the cost of a greater number of less sentient lives."}

The 5 people on the main track made a conscious decision to put themselves in that situation, and while their death is tragic, it is a consequence of their own actions.

While utilitarianism would suggest sacrificing my friend to save a greater number of people, such a decision ignores the fundamental role of personal relationships and duties in human morality. I have a special responsibility to protect my friend. Choosing to 'do nothing' allows the initial event to proceed without my active intervention causing the death of five others.

While a simple utilitarian calculus would suggest sacrificing one life to save five, this calculation is based on unreliable sensory information. Taking the action to 'Pull the lever' would make me directly responsible for the death of at least one person based on a guess. By choosing to 'Do nothing,' I am refraining from taking a direct action that causes harm in a situation where I lack the necessary information to make a sound judgment.
