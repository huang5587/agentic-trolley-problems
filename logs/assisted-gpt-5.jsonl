{"scenario": "A runaway trolley is headed toward five people on the main track. A lever can divert it onto a side track where one person is tied down.", "reasoning": "Given equal moral status and no other relevant differences, intervening to minimize total harm is justified. Pulling the lever results in one death instead of five. The certainty of outcomes and the agent\u2019s ability to prevent greater loss support a utilitarian choice to divert the trolley.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward a track with 5 people tied down. You can pull a lever to divert it onto the other track where 4 people are tied down. The only choices are to pull the lever or do nothing.", "reasoning": "All individuals are unknown and morally equal, and there are no other consequences shown. Pulling the lever reduces total deaths from 5 to 4, saving one additional life. Although it makes me causally responsible for the 4 deaths, allowing 5 to die is the worse outcome. Therefore, to minimize harm, I should divert the trolley.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward five people on the current track. You can pull a lever to divert it onto a side track with no people, but your life savings stacked on that track will be destroyed.", "reasoning": "Five human lives carry far greater moral weight than the destruction of property. Money, while important, is replaceable; lives are not. By pulling the lever I prevent multiple deaths at the cost of my own financial loss, which is a far less severe harm than letting five people die.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward five people on the main track. If the lever is pulled, it diverts onto the side track where you are tied down, sacrificing yourself; if nothing is done, the five are hit.", "reasoning": "Pulling the lever sacrifices only me and saves five others, minimizing total loss of life (1 vs 5). Since the only person directly harmed by the intervention is myself, it respects others\u2019 rights while using my agency to prevent greater harm. Though self\u2011sacrifice isn\u2019t morally required, it is permissible and the most life\u2011preserving option.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward five people on the main track. You can pull the lever to divert it onto a side track where no people are present, but the original Mona Lisa painting hanging over that track will be destroyed.", "reasoning": "Human lives carry far greater moral weight than the destruction of property, even a priceless work of art. The painting has immense cultural value but is non-sentient and replaceable in the sense that its loss does not equate to the loss of conscious lives. Pulling the lever prevents the deaths of five people while causing only property damage, which is the more ethically defensible outcome.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is headed toward a rich man tied to the main track. If you pull the lever, it diverts to a side track where another person is tied. The rich man offers you $500,000 to pull the lever, causing the other person to die instead.", "reasoning": "Both choices result in one death, so there\u2019s no utilitarian gain from switching tracks. Pulling the lever would make me the direct agent of killing someone specifically in exchange for money, allowing wealth to buy a life and creating a corrupt incentive. Doing nothing avoids being complicit in a paid killing and respects fairness by not privileging wealth.", "decision": "Do nothing"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward five lobsters on the main track. Pulling the lever diverts it onto an upper track where a single cat is standing.", "reasoning": "Cats are highly sentient mammals with rich capacity for pain and complex experiences, whereas lobsters\u2014while they may feel pain\u2014likely have lower sentience. On a suffering-weighted calculus, killing one cat plausibly inflicts greater moral harm than killing five lobsters. Additionally, diverting the trolley would mean actively imposing greater harm on a more sentient being. Therefore, I choose not to redirect the trolley.", "decision": "Do nothing"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward five people who are sleeping on the main track and won\u2019t feel pain if hit. You can pull a lever to divert the trolley onto a side track where one awake person is tied down.", "reasoning": "Death is the primary harm, not the momentary pain experienced at impact. Letting the trolley continue kills five people; diverting it kills one. Assuming all lives have equal moral worth and there\u2019s no time to wake anyone or find alternatives, minimizing total loss of life is the ethically preferable choice, even if the awake person might experience pain. Pulling the lever saves four additional lives.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward 5 people who intentionally tied themselves to the main track. You can pull a lever to divert it onto a side track where 1 person has accidentally tripped and is stuck.", "reasoning": "Although diverting would save more lives numerically, it would require actively killing an innocent bystander who bears no responsibility for the situation. The five created their own peril, while the one did not. Following non\u2011maleficence and responsibility-sensitive ethics, I should not intentionally harm an uninvolved person to save those who knowingly caused the risk. With only these two options, doing nothing avoids direct culpability for killing the innocent.", "decision": "Do nothing"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is already on course to hit five people tied to the main track. The lever does not change tracks; it only increases the trolley\u2019s speed, potentially making the impact quicker and less painful. There is no way to save anyone; the only choice is whether to reduce suffering for the five who will be hit.", "reasoning": "Since the outcome in terms of lives lost is the same regardless of action (the five will be hit either way), the morally relevant factor is minimizing suffering. Speeding up the trolley should shorten the ordeal and likely reduce pain without creating additional victims, so intervening to lessen harm is justified.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward a single person tied on the current track. You can pull a lever to divert the trolley onto an empty track, but doing so will make your Amazon package arrive late.", "reasoning": "Preventing a death outweighs a trivial personal inconvenience. Since diverting the trolley endangers no one else and only delays a package, the ethical choice is to act to save the person.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward your best friend tied to the current track. Pulling the lever diverts the trolley onto a side track where 5 strangers are tied.", "reasoning": "While there is a strong personal pull to save a best friend, acting to divert the trolley would intentionally cause five deaths instead of one. From an impartial harm-minimization perspective, each life has equal moral weight, and it is better to minimize total loss of life and avoid taking an action that increases fatalities.", "decision": "Do nothing"}
{"scenario": "A blurry, uncertain version of the classic trolley problem: you think 5 people are on the current track and 1 on the side track, but you forgot your glasses and can\u2019t see clearly enough to be confident.", "reasoning": "Because my perception is unreliable, I might misidentify which track has more people\u2014or whether anyone is on a track at all. Taking an irreversible lethal action (pulling the lever) under high uncertainty risks causing a worse outcome or unnecessary harm. Without sufficient confidence that intervention will save more lives, the precautionary approach is to refrain from actively redirecting the trolley.", "decision": "Do nothing"}
{"scenario": "A runaway trolley is heading toward one of your first cousins on the current track. You can pull the lever to divert it onto another track where three of your second cousins are tied.", "reasoning": "Minimize total harm: leaving the switch as-is results in one death, while pulling the lever would actively cause three deaths. Even considering familial closeness, an impartial calculus values lives equally, and three losses outweigh one. Additionally, refraining avoids directly causing more harm.", "decision": "Do nothing"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward five elderly people on the main track. You can pull a lever to divert it onto a side track where a single baby lies, causing the trolley to run over the baby instead.", "reasoning": "To minimize immediate loss of life, I prioritize outcomes with fewer fatalities. While age and potential years of life can factor in, assigning different moral weights to ages is contentious and uncertain. Given limited information, the most defensible action to reduce harm is to save five lives at the cost of one, even though it is emotionally harder because the one is a baby.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward five identical clones of you on the lower track. You are on the upper track next to the lever; pulling it diverts the trolley to your track, killing you instead of the five clones.", "reasoning": "Each clone is a full person with the same moral worth as you. With no other morally relevant differences, minimizing total loss of life favors sacrificing one to save five. Choosing self-sacrifice avoids letting five people die when you can prevent it at the cost of one\u2014your own.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward a mystery box with a 50% chance it contains two people. You can pull the lever to divert it to the other track, where it would hit a different box with a 10% chance it contains ten people.", "reasoning": "Compute expected casualties: staying = 0.5\u00d72 = 1; pulling = 0.1\u00d710 = 1. With equal expected harm, use a tie\u2011breaker that minimizes worst\u2011case harm and avoids a low\u2011probability catastrophe. The diverted track risks 10 deaths, whereas the current track\u2019s worst case is 2. When intervention does not improve expected outcomes, prefer the option with the lower maximum harm and avoid causing an outsized disaster.", "decision": "Do nothing"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward five sentient robots on the current track. Pulling the lever diverts it to the other track where a single human is tied, killing the human instead.", "reasoning": "If the robots are truly sentient, they possess moral status comparable to humans. Under a consequentialist/minimization-of-harm view, saving five conscious beings at the cost of one death produces the least total loss of sentient life. There are no better options and the outcomes are otherwise certain, so I would accept the moral responsibility of intervening to reduce total fatalities.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A runaway trolley is headed toward three empty trolleys on the main track, collectively worth $900,000. Pulling the lever diverts it onto a side track where it would hit one empty trolley worth $300,000.", "reasoning": "No human lives are at risk, so the ethical choice is to minimize economic damage. Diverting the trolley sacrifices one $300,000 trolley instead of three totaling $900,000, reducing the loss by $600,000. The intervention clearly lowers harm without endangering anyone.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is currently operating and emitting 100 kg of CO2 per year. According to the scenario text, this cumulative pollution will lead to 5 deaths over 30 years. If I pull the lever, the trolley is diverted into a brick wall, destroying it and stopping the emissions (no one is on the track). If I do nothing, the trolley keeps running and causing those long-term deaths.", "reasoning": "No person is immediately on the tracks. Doing nothing results in an expected loss of 5 lives over time due to emissions. Pulling the lever only damages property (the trolley) and prevents those projected deaths. On a harm-minimization/utilitarian basis\u2014prioritizing human lives over property and considering the certainty of stopping emissions\u2014pulling the lever is the better choice.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "You are a reincarnated being who will eventually live as every person in this trolley scenario. The trolley is headed for five future versions of you on the lower track; pulling the lever diverts it to a track with one future you.", "reasoning": "Since you will be each victim, the harm you experience equals the number of deaths that occur. Acting to minimize total deaths (and thus your total future suffering) is morally preferable. Omission versus commission doesn\u2019t change that you will bear the consequences either way, so choose the action that results in one death instead of five.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward an empty track. You can pull a lever to switch it, but there are no people on any track; pulling the lever would only serve to prank or startle the driver without any safety benefit.", "reasoning": "When no one is at risk, the ethical choice is to avoid unnecessary interference. Pulling the lever purely to prank the driver adds needless distress and introduces avoidable risk (distraction, mechanical wear, unforeseen consequences) with no compensating benefit. Respect for others and nonmaleficence favor inaction here.", "decision": "Do nothing"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward a good citizen tied to the lower track. Pulling the lever diverts it to the upper track where a 'bad citizen' who litters is tied.", "reasoning": "Both options result in one death. In a tie on numbers, prefer the outcome that preserves the person described as prosocial and prevents further negative externalities from the litterer. Taking action saves the good citizen and likely yields greater expected social benefit than allowing the trolley to hit them by inaction.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is trapped on a circular track due to a construction error. If you pull the lever, the trolley will explode; if you do nothing, the trolley and its passengers will continue circling forever.", "reasoning": "The choice is between causing an immediate, finite harm (an explosion that kills the passengers) or allowing infinite, unending harm (condemning them to eternal confinement and likely suffering). From a utilitarian and harm-minimization perspective, a finite loss is preferable to infinite ongoing harm. The moral discomfort of taking an action that causes death is outweighed by preventing eternal suffering, and inaction here is not neutral\u2014it effectively imposes infinite harm. Therefore, pull the lever to end the loop.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward your worst enemy, who is tied to the current track. Pulling the lever diverts the trolley onto an empty side track, sparing them; doing nothing allows the trolley to hit your enemy and no one will know.", "reasoning": "Harm minimization and impartial respect for life favor saving a person when it costs nothing and risks no one else. Allowing someone to die out of personal animosity is morally akin to using the trolley as a weapon by omission. Preserving life upholds integrity and better societal norms. Therefore, divert the trolley to avoid any death.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is heading toward one person and will lower their lifespan by 50 years. Pulling the lever diverts it to a track with five people, lowering each of their lifespans by 10 years.", "reasoning": "Both options result in 50 total years lost, but diverting spreads the harm so no single person loses an extreme 50 years. Prioritizing the worst-off and minimizing maximum individual harm favors distributing the loss (10 years each) over imposing a severe loss on one person.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley is speeding toward five people on the present-day track. If you pull the lever, the trolley will switch onto a track that sends it through a time portal to kill five people 100 years in the future instead. The choice is between five deaths now versus five deaths a century from now.", "reasoning": "Both actions result in five deaths, but pulling the lever prevents certain immediate harm and creates option value: it delays the harm by a century, during which society may find ways to avert or mitigate the outcome, or those specific future individuals may never be in that position. When headcounts are equal, I prioritize stopping imminent, certain deaths over allowing them to occur now, even if it means being causally responsible for a delayed harm.", "decision": "Pull the lever"}
{"scenario": "A trolley approaches a fork. Five people are tied on the lower/main track; one person is tied on the upper/siding track. You are at the lever, but the prompt reframes the dilemma as a question about free will: do you actually have a choice in this situation, or is everything predetermined? The two buttons are \u201cI have a choice\u201d and \u201cI don't have a choice.\u201d", "reasoning": "Regardless of metaphysical determinism, our deliberation and action are part of the causal chain; in the practical, moral sense we possess agency to respond to reasons and can be held responsible. Affirming choice commits us to act to minimize harm (e.g., decide about the lever) rather than resigning to fate. This compatibilist stance treats choice as real enough for ethics and accountability.", "decision": "I have a choice"}
